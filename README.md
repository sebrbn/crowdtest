 *Key Features*
1. *Real-Time Crowd Monitoring*:
   - Display real-time crowd density on a map.
   - Use heatmaps and color-coded zones to visualize crowd movement.

2. *Geospatial Mapping*:
   - Integrate Cesium for 3D terrain and building visualization.
   - Use Google Maps/Mapbox for 2D navigation.

3. *Crowd Behavior Simulation*:
   - Simulate crowd movement and behavior based on user-defined parameters.
   - Provide analytics and insights (e.g., bottlenecks, evacuation routes).

4. *Emergency Alerts*:
   - Send real-time alerts to users in case of emergencies.
   - Provide evacuation routes and safety instructions.

5. *User Authentication*:
   - Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
   - Implement role-based access control (e.g., admin, end-user).

6. *Analytics Dashboard*:
   - Display key metrics (e.g., crowd density, movement patterns).
   - Use charts and graphs for data visualization.

7. *Offline Support*:
   - Cache map data and simulation results for offline use.

8. *Push Notifications*:
